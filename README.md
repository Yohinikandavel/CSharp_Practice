# 💻 C# Training Programs – Exception Handling & File Operations

Welcome to my hands-on C# programming repository! This collection includes practice programs developed as part of my training, focusing on core concepts like **exception handling**, **custom exception classes**, **file and directory operations**, and a **mini project on student records**.

---

## 📁 Repository Overview

**My Hands-On C# program practices are uploaded in this repository**, covering:

### ✅ Exception Handling
- Student marks input validation using try-catch blocks
- Range checking and format validation
- Finally block demonstration

### ✅ Custom Exceptions
- `AgeValidationException` – Age < 18 restriction
- `InvalidStudentIDException` – Student ID format validation
- `InsufficientBalanceException` – Banking example
- `InvalidGradeException` – Grade entry validation
- `LoginFailedException` – Inner exception usage
- Base class: `ApplicationCustomException`

### ✅ File Handling
- Create, read, write, and append to text files
- Copying files using `File.Copy`
- Using `FileInfo` to get file metadata
- Directory creation and listing files
- FileNotFoundException handling

### ✅ Mini Project: Student Record System
A file-based project with menu options to:
- Add student records
- View all students
- Search by roll number
- Delete records
- Exit application

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open the `.cs` files in **Visual Studio** or any C# compatible IDE.
2. Use `.NET 6.0` or later for best compatibility.
3. Run individual files as needed.
4. For file handling programs, ensure the working directory allows read/write access.
